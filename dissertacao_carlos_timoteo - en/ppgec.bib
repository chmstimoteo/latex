  title={Pseudorandom Number Generation: Impossibility and Compromise},
  abstract={Pseudorandom number generators are widely used in the area of simulation. Defective generators are still widely used in standard library programs, although better pseudorandom number generators such as the Mersenne Twister are freely available. This manuscript gives a brief explanation on pseudorandom number generators for Monte Carlo simulation. The existing definitions of pseudorandomness are not satisfactorially practical, since the generation of sequences satisfying the definitions is sometimes impossible, somtimes rather slow. As a compromise, to design a fast and reliable generator, some mathematical indices are used as measures of pseudorandomness, such as the period and the higher-dimensional equidistribution property. There is no rigorous justification for the use of these indices as measures of pseudorandomness, but experiences show their usefulness in choosing pseudorandom number generators.}, journal=j-jucs, year = {"2006"}, volume = {"12"}, number = {"6"}, pages = {"672--690"},}

abstract={The application of neural networks to the optimum routing problem in packet-switched computer networks, where the goal is to minimize the network-wide average time delay, is addressed. Under appropriate assumptions, the optimum routing algorithm relies heavily on shortest path computations that have to be carried out in real time. For this purpose an efficient neural network shortest path algorithm that is an improved version of previously suggested Hopfield models is proposed. The general principles involved in the design of the proposed neural network are discussed in detail. Its computational power is demonstrated through computer simulations. One of the main features of the proposed model is that it will enable the routing algorithm to be implemented in real time and also to be adaptive to changes in link costs and network topology},

    abstract = {Traditional methods for creating intelligent computational systems have<br>privileged private "internal" cognitive and computational processes. In contrast, Swarm Intelligence argues that humanintelligence derives from the interactions of individuals in a social world and further, that this model of intelligence can be effectively applied to artificially intelligent systems. The authors first present the foundations of this new approach through an extensive review of the critical literature in social psychology, cognitive science, and evolutionary computation. They then show in detail how these theories and models apply to a new computational intelligence methodologyparticle swarmswhich focuses on adaptation as the key behavior of intelligent systems. Drilling down still further, the authors describe the practical benefits of applying particle<br>swarm optimization to a range of engineering problems. Developed by the authors, this algorithm is an extension of cellular automata and provides a powerful optimization, learning, and problem solving method. This important book presents valuable new insights by exploring the boundaries shared by cognitive science, social psychology, artificial life, artificial intelligence, and evolutionary computation and by applying these insights to the solving of difficult engineering problems. Researchers and graduate students in any of these disciplines will find the material intriguing, provocative, and revealing as will the curious and savvy computing professional. * Places particle swarms within the larger context of intelligent adaptive behavior and evolutionary computation. * Describes recent results of experiments with the particle swarm<br>optimization (PSO) algorithm * Includes a basic overview of statistics to ensure readers can properly analyze the results of their own experiments using the algorithm. * Support software which can be downloaded from the publishers website, includes a Java PSO applet, C and Visual Basic source code.},

    abstract = {The particle swarm algorithm adjusts the trajectories of a population of \&ldquo;particles\&rdquo; through a problem space on the basis of information about each particle's previous best performance and the best previous performance of its neighbors. Previous versions of the particle swarm have operated in continuous space, where trajectories are defined as changes in position on some number of dimensions. The paper reports a reworking of the algorithm to operate on discrete binary variables. In the binary version, trajectories are changes in the probability that a coordinate will take on a zero or one value. Examples, applications, and issues are discussed},

It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.},

The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices.},

    abstract = {Highly-interconnected networks of nonlinear analog neurons are shown to be extremely effective in computing. The networks can rapidly provide a collectively-computed solution (a digital output) to a problem on the basis of analog input information. The problems to be solved must be formulated in terms of desired optima, often subject to constraints. The general principles involved in constructing networks to solve specific problems are discussed. Results of computer simulations of a network designed to solve a difficult but well-defined optimization problem-the Traveling-Salesman Problem-are presented and used to illustrate the computational power of the networks. Good solutions to this problem are collectively computed within an elapsed time of only a few neural time constants. The effectiveness of the computation involves both the nonlinear analog response of the neurons and the large connectivity among them. Dedicated networks of biological or microelectronic neurons could provide the computational capabilities described for a wide class of problems having combinatorial complexity. The power and speed naturally displayed by such collective networks may contribute to the effectiveness of biological information processing.},

The distinguished authors take advantage of the many recent advances in neurobiology and molecular biology to include new coverage of such critical discoveries as stem cells, apoptosis, the role of the amygdala in stress, and the significance of dendritic spines. Among the core topics given expanded treatments are pain and pain pathways, the visual system, development and growth of the nervous system, the chemical senses of smell and taste, and the limbic system. There is also fresh material on neuronal stem cells, the auditory and vestibular systems, neurotransmitters as the chemical messengers of certain brain circuits, the cerebellum, and lesions of the spinal nerves, spinal cord, and brainstem. The superb illustrations are designed to extract and visually highlight the essence of the neuroanatomical features embedded in the complexities of the nervous system, thereby allowing the reader to match the structures of the brain with conventional X-ray pictures, and CT, MRI, and PET scans.},

This paper analyzes a particle's trajectory as it moves in discrete time (the algebraic view), then progresses to the view of it in continuous time (the analytical view). A five-dimensional depiction is developed, which describes the system completely. These analyses lead to a generalized model of the algorithm, containing a set of coefficients to control the system's convergence tendencies. Some results of the particle swarm optimizer, implementing modifications derived from the analysis, suggest methods for altering the original algorithm in ways that eliminate problems and increase the ability of the particle swarm to find optima of some well-studied test functions},

@book{eberhart,
    abstract = {Traditional methods for creating intelligent computational systems have<br>privileged private "internal" cognitive and computational processes. In contrast, Swarm Intelligence argues that humanintelligence derives from the interactions of individuals in a social world and further, that this model of intelligence can be effectively applied to artificially intelligent systems. The authors first present the foundations of this new approach through an extensive review of the critical literature in social psychology, cognitive science, and evolutionary computation. They then show in detail how these theories and models apply to a new computational intelligence methodologyparticle swarmswhich focuses on adaptation as the key behavior of intelligent systems. Drilling down still further, the authors describe the practical benefits of applying particle<br>swarm optimization to a range of engineering problems. Developed by the authors, this algorithm is an extension of cellular automata and provides a powerful optimization, learning, and problem solving method. This important book presents valuable new insights by exploring the boundaries shared by cognitive science, social psychology, artificial life, artificial intelligence, and evolutionary computation and by applying these insights to the solving of difficult engineering problems. Researchers and graduate students in any of these disciplines will find the material intriguing, provocative, and revealing as will the curious and savvy computing professional. * Places particle swarms within the larger context of intelligent adaptive behavior and evolutionary computation. * Describes recent results of experiments with the particle swarm<br>optimization (PSO) algorithm * Includes a basic overview of statistics to ensure readers can properly analyze the results of their own experiments using the algorithm. * Support software which can be downloaded from the publishers website, includes a Java PSO applet, C and Visual Basic source code.},

    abstract = {The particle swarm algorithm adjusts the trajectories of a population of \&ldquo;particles\&rdquo; through a problem space on the basis of information about each particle's previous best performance and the best previous performance of its neighbors. Previous versions of the particle swarm have operated in continuous space, where trajectories are defined as changes in position on some number of dimensions. The paper reports a reworking of the algorithm to operate on discrete binary variables. In the binary version, trajectories are changes in the probability that a coordinate will take on a zero or one value. Examples, applications, and issues are discussed},

The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices.},

@article{Hopfield85,
    abstract = {Highly-interconnected networks of nonlinear analog neurons are shown to be extremely effective in computing. The networks can rapidly provide a collectively-computed solution (a digital output) to a problem on the basis of analog input information. The problems to be solved must be formulated in terms of desired optima, often subject to constraints. The general principles involved in constructing networks to solve specific problems are discussed. Results of computer simulations of a network designed to solve a difficult but well-defined optimization problem-the Traveling-Salesman Problem-are presented and used to illustrate the computational power of the networks. Good solutions to this problem are collectively computed within an elapsed time of only a few neural time constants. The effectiveness of the computation involves both the nonlinear analog response of the neurons and the large connectivity among them. Dedicated networks of biological or microelectronic neurons could provide the computational capabilities described for a wide class of problems having combinatorial complexity. The power and speed naturally displayed by such collective networks may contribute to the effectiveness of biological information processing.},

@book{citeulike:2183497,
    abstract = {Now in its sixth best-selling edition, The Human Nervous System: Structure and Function continues to combine clear prose with high quality tailor-made medical illustrations to achieve for neuroscientists and medical students a succinct explanation of the fundamental principles behind the organization, structure, and function of the human nervous system. The distinguished authors take advantage of the many recent advances in neurobiology and molecular biology to include new coverage of such critical discoveries as stem cells, apoptosis, the role of the amygdala in stress, and the significance of dendritic spines. Among the core topics given expanded treatments are pain and pain pathways, the visual system, development and growth of the nervous system, the chemical senses of smell and taste, and the limbic system. There is also fresh material on neuronal stem cells, the auditory and vestibular systems, neurotransmitters as the chemical messengers of certain brain circuits, the cerebellum, and lesions of the spinal nerves, spinal cord, and brainstem. The superb illustrations are designed to extract and visually highlight the essence of the neuroanatomical features embedded in the complexities of the nervous system, thereby allowing the reader to match the structures of the brain with conventional X-ray pictures, and CT, MRI, and PET scans.},
