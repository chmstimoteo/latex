\textbf{DEDICATION}
\\
\\
Firstly, I want to thank God for giving me health and peace, and to make everything possible. I have to thank a lot to my father for his understanding and to my mother for her unconditional support. A special thanks to my brother by his cheer, support and for motivating me during this journey.

I am very grateful to my supervisor, Professor Carmelo, for all learning and guidance. When working by his side, I found my vocation as a professor. He is my example of professor, researcher and advisor. What he taught me is not found in books. He taught me to believe in the potential of students, motivate them, let them excited during classes and respect people. Thus, he won the admiration of all the people. I thank all the professors of the Postgraduate Program in Computing Engineering for their contribution to my development. I also thank the undergraduate student Sergio Ribeiro due to our successful partnership.

I want to thank my friends of now and forever, Cesar, Caio, Thiago, George, Victor and Silvia for all the support. Despite the distance, they always were with me. It is always good to make new friends. Finally, I want to thank all the new friends and colleagues that I did during these two years, Paulo Roger, Debora, Marcelo, Renatha, Rodrigo (teoria) because my master's degree would not be the same without their support.

A special thank to the secretaries Ana Georgina and Julia by their conversations and help. They welcomed me with a smile when I arrived and said "Hi" always.

I know that I can lose contact with most of these people due the circumstances, but I want to record my thanks for they having entered into my life.
