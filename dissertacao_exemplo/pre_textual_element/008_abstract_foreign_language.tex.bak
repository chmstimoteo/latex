Swarm Intelligence is one of the research areas of computational intelligence that most evolved in the last years. The swarm intelligence algorithms are bio-inspired and are usually used for search and optimization problems. They often have mechanisms to simultaneously represent success, guarantee of convergence and maintain diversity. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is one of the most known swarm intelligence algorithms. PSO uses the best positions found in the search space and intensifies the search in some of the most promising regions. On the other hand, the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm uses the concept of food sources. The bees explore these food source, and if the quality of these food sources are not improving over the iterations, these sources are abandoned.

These algorithms have excellent skills to solve complex problems. However, many of them lose their efficiency when applied to optimization problems with high dimensionality, \textit{e.g.} 1000 decision variables. Thus, a proper combination of swarm intelligence algorithms that present different features can be a suitable alternative to solve optimization problems with high dimensionality.

In this dissertation, the proposal is to combine the PSO algorithm with adaptive behavior (Adaptive PSO - APSO) with the ABC. The APSO algorithm has a good mechanism to accelerate the convergence and ABC has the ability to maintain diversity. This combination is called \emph{Bee and Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization} (\emph{ABeePSO}). The performance of the ABeePSO algorithm was evaluated in the benchmark optimization suite proposed in CEC 2010. We performed a detailed analysis regarding convergence, diversity and scalability. We also compare our approach to other well known swarm intelligence algorithms. The results suggest that the performance of the ABeePSO algorithm is superior, mainly in high dimensionality search spaces.
